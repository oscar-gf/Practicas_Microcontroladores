# Microcontroller Laboratory


## Introduction

Microcontrollers are all around  he world. Each day, Microcontrollers, are more present in the many aspects of our lives: in our work, inside our houses, and in more. We can find them controlling small devices like cellphones, microwaves, washing machines, and televisions.

A microcontroller is one device or chip that is used to govern one or more processes. For example, the controller that regulates the room temperature of an air conditioner; it has a sensor that continuously measures the internal temperature and, when the preset limits are exceeded, it generates the necessary signals to adjust the temperature.

## State of the Art

### The practices and the PIC microcontroller

The main objective of this practices is to provide students the foundation to fully understand the operation of the PIC18F45K50 microcontroller. This will be achieved through 11 documents that will guide the reader to create their own electronic card or Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and to be able to program it; in order to, execute different functions.

The advantages of ta PIC microcontroller to others on the market, which is why it will be used throughout this manual, are as follows:

- Easy to operate.
- There is enough documentation to work with it and itâ€™s easy to obtain it.
- The price is comparatively lower than its competitors.
- It has a high operating speed.
- Development tools are cheap and easy to use.
- There are a variety of hardware that can record, erase and check the behavior of PIC.
- Once you learn to handle a PIC, it will easier to handle any other models of microcontrollers.


### KiCad EDA Software

KiCad is an open source software suite for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The programs handle Schematic Capture,
and PCB Layout with Gerber output. The suite runs on Windows, Linux and macOS and is licensed under GNU GPL v3. The
first release date was in 1992 by its original author, Jean-Pierre Charras, but is now currently under development by
the KiCad Developers Team.
